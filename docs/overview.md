# Overview

Welcome to our Instructor-Led Lab "ACI and Red Hat OpenShift for Cloud-Native Workloads and Virtualization"! 

 In this hands-on lab session, you will delve into the powerful integration of Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, showcasing their synergy for managing cloud-native workloads and virtualization environments. The session will highlight deploying OpenShift clusters on bare metal servers and exploring the integration of ACI Container Network Interface (CNI) for enhanced network visibility and security.

## Upon completion of this lab you will:

- Gain practical experience in provisioning OpenShift clusters on bare metal servers, exploring different bootstrap methods, such as user-provisioned infrastructure with PXE boot.
- Understand the integration of ACI with OpenShift, exploring ACI CNI integration features, such as segmentation using end point groups, ACI hardware-assisted load balancing, and Source NAT.
- Be able to deploy example applications on the OpenShift clusters to understand the practical aspects of managing containerized workloads.
- Practice managing virtual machines on OpenShift leveraging OpenShift Virtualization

## Prerequisites

- Participants should have a basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts.
- Familiarity with Cisco ACI will be beneficial for a deeper understanding of the integration aspects.

## Disclaimer

Although the lab design and configuration examples could be used as a reference, itâ€™s not a real design, thus not all recommended features are used, or enabled optimally. For the design related questions please contact your representative at Cisco, or a Cisco partner.

## Overview of OpenShift

OpenShift Container Platform, developed by Red Hat, is a comprehensive Kubernetes container platform designed to simplify the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust and flexible environment for building, deploying, and running applications across hybrid and multicloud infrastructures.
